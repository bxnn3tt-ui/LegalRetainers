## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between a lead and a signed case?
A lead is an inquiry from someone who might need legal help. A signed case includes a client who has already executed a retainer agreement, been verified for eligibility, and provided documentation. The attorney-client relationship is already established.

### What types of cases do you provide?
We provide pre-qualified cases across personal injury (motor vehicle, slip and fall, medical malpractice), mass torts (defective drugs, product liability), institutional abuse, and employment law. Each case includes a signed retainer agreement.

### How quickly can I receive cases?
Most cases are delivered within 24-48 hours of approval. We maintain active case pipelines across all major practice areas.

### Are the clients already signed?
Yes. Every case includes a signed legal representation agreement. Clients have already committed to representation before delivery to your firm.

### How do you verify case quality?
All cases are pre-screened by legal professionals for eligibility, jurisdiction, and merit. We verify prospect information and documentation completeness before delivery.

### What documentation is included with each case?
Each case includes: signed representation agreements, client intake forms, medical authorizations (HIPAA releases), initial case assessment, and jurisdiction verification.

### Is your lead generation TCPA-compliant?
Yes. We maintain 100% TCPA compliance across all lead generation activities with documented consent and disclosure protocols.

### Do you serve firms nationwide?
Yes. We provide cases to licensed plaintiff law firms across all 50 United States, matching cases to appropriate jurisdictions.

### What makes LegalRetainers different from lead generation services?
We deliver signed clients, not leads. Traditional lead generation requires firms to convert inquiries into clients (typically 3-10% success rate). We deliver clients who have already signed representation agreements.

### Why do most law firm leads not convert to signed cases?
Most leads don't convert because they're information seekers or price shoppers, not ready-to-sign clients. Slow response times, inadequate follow-up, and intake process failures also lose good cases.

### How can law firms make intake more predictable?
Focus on quality over volume, work with pre-qualified sources, optimize conversion before scaling lead volume, and consider pre-signed case acquisition to bypass intake challenges entirely.
